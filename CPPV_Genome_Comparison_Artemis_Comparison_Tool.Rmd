# Aligning one sequence against another with BLAST
# Using Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)

# Steps:
# 1. run makeblastdb to make the database
# 2. run BLAST to align the query with this database

General commands:

# make a DNA database from the sequence "example.fasta" called EXAMPLE_DB
makeblastdb -dbtype nucl -in example.fasta -out EXAMPLE_DB


# search for "query.fasta" in EXAMPLE_DB with tabular output (-outfmt 6)
# this is sent to the file blast.out
blastn -db EXAMPLE_DB -query query.fasta -outfmt 6 > blast.out


# Run Artemis for Comparison Analysis
./act file1.gb blast1.out file2.gb  blast2.out file3.gb



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
